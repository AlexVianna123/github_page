    <h1> Sydney most wanted beaches for bodyboard! </h1>
    <h2>Maroubra</h2>

    <p>Beach break, with a point at either end.
        Works on most swells with any east in it, and both ends get some protection from the wind.
        
        North end works best on a big swell, but it WILL be crowded and the locals are very talented. A steep, fast wave which can be dumpy. Not one for the faint hearted, and dont expect a long ride unless you're confident enough to go out on a big day and mix with the locals.
        
        South end a touch more mellow, but still an aggressive and talented crowd. Gets shelter from southerly winds and waves so often a bit more manageable when the big SE swells roll in.
        
        Best surf in Sydney.

    <h2>North bondi</h2>

    <p>Located in the eastern suburbs, Bondi Beach is arguably Australia's most famous beach â€“ and a great place to learn to surf. While the waves in the middle of Bondi Beach can get pretty wild, further up towards the northern corner provides protection thanks to the Ben Buckler headland, making it a great surfing spot.

    <h2>Bronte</h2>

    <p>The best time of year for surfing Bronte Beach with consistent clean waves (rideable swell with light / offshore winds) is during Winter and most often the month of July. Clean surfable waves are typically found 47% of the time in July while 33% of the time it tends to be blown out.</p>

    <h2>North Curl Curl</h2>

    <p>It's one of Sydney's best surfing beaches . The beach is divided into North Curl Curl & South Curl Curl locally known as Curly's. The northern part also has a lagoon which flows into the ocean & is the safest beach to swim at. South Curl Curl can get dangerous rips so it's important to swim between the flags.<br> </p><br> </br><br> </br></p>
